			<h2>Introduction to Computer Program</h2>
			<p>Before getting into computer programming, let us first understand computer programs and what they do.</p>
			<p>&emsp; <em>A computer program is a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming Language to perform a specified task by the computer.</em></p>
			<p>The two important terms that we have used in the above definition are</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sequence of instructions</li>
				<li>Computer Programming Language</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To understand these terms, consider a situation when someone asks you about how to go to a nearby KFC. What exactly do you do to tell him the way to go to KFC?</p>
			<p>You will use Human Language to tell the way to go to KFC, something as follows</p>
			<table cellpadding="12%" align="center"><tr><td bgcolor="#222222"><p><font color="white">First go straight, after half kilometer, take left from the red light and then drive around one kilometer and you will find KFC at the right.</font></p></td></tr></table>
			<p>Here, you have used English Language to give several steps to be taken to reach KFC. If they are followed in the following sequence, then you will reach KFC</p>
			<table cellpadding="12%" align="center"><tr><td bgcolor="#222222"><tt><font color="white">
				<ol>
					<li>&emsp;&emsp;Go straight</li>
					<li>&emsp;&emsp;Drive half kilometer</li>
					<li>&emsp;&emsp;Take left</li>
					<li>&emsp;&emsp;Drive around one kilometer</li>
					<li>&emsp;&emsp;Search for KFC at your right side</li>
				</ol>
			</font></tt></td></tr></table>
			<p>Now, try to map the situation with a computer program. The above sequence of instructions is actually a <strong>Human Program</strong> written in <strong>English Language</strong>, which instructs on how to reach KFC from a given starting point. This same sequence could have been given in Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, or any other human language, provided the person seeking direction knows any of these languages.</p>
			<p>Now, let's go back and try to understand a computer program, which is a sequence of instructions written in a Computer Language to perform a specified task by the computer. Following is a simple program written in <strong>Python</strong> programming Language</p>
			<table cellpadding="12%" align="center"><tr><td bgcolor="#222222"><tt><font color="white">print("Hello, World!")</font></tt></td></tr></table>
			<p>The above computer program instructs the computer to print "Hello, World!" on the computer screen.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A computer program is also called a <strong>computer software</strong>, which can range from two lines to millions of lines of instructions.</li>
				<li>Computer program instructions are also called program source code and <strong>computer programming</strong> is also called <strong>program coding</strong>.</li>
				<li>A computer without a computer program is just a dump box; it is programs that make computers active.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we have developed so many languages to communicate among ourselves, computer scientists have developed several computer-programming languages to provide instructions to the computer (i.e., to write computer programs). We will see several computer programming languages in the subsequent chapters.</p>
			<h2>Introduction to Computer Programming</h2>
			<p>If you understood what a <strong>computer program</strong> is, then we will say: <em>the act of writing computer programs is called computer programming.</em></p>
			<p>As we mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of programming languages, which can be used to write computer programs and following are a few of them</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Perl</li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Uses of Computer Programs</h2>
			<p>Today computer programs are being used in almost every field, household, agriculture, medical, entertainment, defense, communication, etc. Listed below are a few applications of computer programs</p>
			<ul>
				<li>MS Word, MS Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc., are examples of computer programs.</li>
				<li>Computer programs are being used to develop graphics and special effects in movie making.</li>
				<li>Computer programs are being used to perform Ultrasounds, X-Rays, and other medical examinations.</li>
				<li>Computer programs are being used in our mobile phones for SMS, Chat, and voice communication.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Computer Programmer</h2>
			<p>Someone who can write computer programs or in other words, someone who can do computer programming is called a Computer Programmer.</p>
			<p>Based on computer programming language expertise, we can name a computer programmers as follows</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C Programmer</li>
				<li>C++ Programmer</li>
				<li>Java Programmer</li>
				<li>Python Programmer</li>
				<li>PHP Programmer</li>
				<li>Perl Programmer</li>
				<li>Ruby Programmer</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Algorithm</h2>
			<p>From programming point of view, an <strong>algorithm</strong> is a step-by-step procedure to resolve any problem. An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions.</p>
			<p>Thus, a computer programmer lists down all the steps required to resolve a problem before writing the actual code. Following is a simple example of an algorithm to find out the largest number from a given list of numbers</p>
			<table cellpadding="12%" align="center"><tr><td bgcolor="#222222"><tt><font color="white">
				<ol>

					<sub></sub>

					<li>&emsp;Get a list of numbers L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, L<sub>3</sub>....L<sub>N</sub></li>
					<li>&emsp;Assume L<sub>1</sub> is the largest, Largest = L<sub>1</sub></li>
					<li>&emsp;Take next number L<sub>i</sub> from the list and do the following</li>
					<li>&emsp;If Largest is less than L<sub>i</sub></li>
					<li>&emsp;Largest = L<sub>i</sub></li>
					<li>&emsp;If L<sub>i</sub> is last number from the list then</li>
					<li>&emsp;Print value stored in Largest and come out</li>
					<li>&emsp;Else repeat same process starting from step 3</li>
				</ol>
			</font></tt></td></tr></table>
			<p>The above algorithm has been written in a crude way to help beginners understand the concept. You will come across more standardized ways of writing computer algorithms as you move on to advanced levels of computer programming.</p>
